## Overview

Batch Convert to RVZ is a comprehensive Windows application that provides a user-friendly interface for converting multiple GameCube and Wii game files to the RVZ format. It uses **DolphinTool** from the Dolphin Emulator project for conversions and verification, while providing advanced features like batch processing and archive extraction.

## Features

### Conversion Features
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple files in a single operation.
- **Supported Input Formats**: Handles GameCube and Wii disc images (`.iso`, `.gcm`, `.wbfs`, `.nkit.iso`) and archives containing them (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`).
- **Archive Extraction**: Automatically extracts and processes game files from ZIP, 7Z, and RAR archives using SharpCompress.
- **Configurable Compression**: Customize compression method, level, and block size for optimal results.

- **Smart File Handling**: Skips files that already exist in the output directory.
- **Delete Original Option**: Optionally remove source files (including archives) after successful conversion.
- **Robust Parsing**: Advanced logic for handling compound extensions like `.nkit.iso` and localized number formats.

### Verification Features
- **RVZ Integrity Verification**: Verify the integrity of existing RVZ files using DolphinTool.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live logging of DolphinTool verification output (not just at the end).
- **Batch Verification**: Check multiple RVZ files in a single operation.

- **File Organization**: Automatically move verified files to `_Success` or `_Failed` subfolders.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Get comprehensive verification results for each file.

### User Experience
- **Smooth Progress Tracking**: A single, overall progress bar that smoothly tracks the entire batch operation, including real-time percentages from active tasks.
- **Intelligent Auto-Scroll**: The log viewer only snaps to the bottom if you are already looking at the latest logs, allowing you to read previous errors without interruption.
- **Immediate Cancellation**: Stop extractions and conversions instantly, even for massive 8GB+ files, thanks to asynchronous I/O and cancellation token support.
- **Optimized Logging**: Structured logging with Serilog, handling thousands of lines without UI stuttering or high memory usage.
- **Collapsible Settings Panels**: Settings sections use Expander controls (collapsed by default) to reduce visual clutter in all tabs.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Press F8 to capture the application window as a PNG screenshot.
- **Thread-Safe Dialogs**: Robust UI handling that prevents crashes when showing error messages or update prompts from background threads.
- **Auto-Update Checking**: Accurate version comparison between GitHub release tags and assembly versions with seamless GitHub integration.

### Technical Features
- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Fully async/await implementation to keep the UI responsive during intensive I/O and processing.
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Native support for both x64 and ARM64 Windows systems.
- **Structured Logging**: Serilog-based logging with rolling daily log files, on-screen log viewer, and automatic bug reporting via custom sinks.
- **Global Error Reporting**: Automatic bug reporting to developers with comprehensive error details.
- **Process Error Suppression**: Prevents Windows error dialogs from child processes (DolphinTool) from blocking batch operations.
- **Robust Cleanup**: Asynchronous retry logic for deleting locked temporary files and directories.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient string handling and proper resource disposal to prevent leaks.

## About RVZ Format

RVZ is a compressed disk image format developed specifically for the Dolphin Emulator. It is designed to store GameCube and Wii game data efficiently while retaining all necessary information for emulation.

### Key Benefits
- **Efficient Compression**: Significantly reduces file sizes compared to raw ISO images using advanced compression algorithms like Zstandard.
- **Lossless**: Compression is completely lossless, meaning no game data is lost during conversion.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains all important disc metadata and structure.
- **Data Integrity**: Includes built-in verification to ensure image integrity.
- **Full Compatibility**: Directly supported by modern versions of Dolphin Emulator.
- **Faster Loading**: Often loads faster than uncompressed ISOs due to reduced I/O overhead.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure `DolphinTool.exe` (or `DolphinTool_arm64.exe` for ARM64 systems) is present in the application directory.
- **Permission Issues**: Make sure you have read permissions for input directories and write permissions for output directories.
- **Archive Extraction Failures**: Verify that the archive files are not corrupted. The app now supports instant cancellation if extraction hangs.
- **Conversion Errors**: Check the detailed real-time log output for specific error messages. Log files are also saved to `%LocalAppData%\BatchConvertToRVZ\logs\`.
- **Performance Issues**: Try reducing the number of concurrent files if you experience system instability.
- **Auto-Reporting**: The application automatically reports unexpected errors to developers for continuous improvement.
