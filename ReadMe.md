## Overview

RVZStudio is a comprehensive desktop application built with **Avalonia UI** that provides a user-friendly interface for converting multiple GameCube and Wii game files to the RVZ format. The built-in **RVZSharp** library is the primary engine for conversion, extraction and verification, with **DolphinTool** from the Dolphin Emulator project as a fallback, while providing advanced features like batch processing and archive extraction.

The application ships for **Windows, Linux and macOS** on both **x64 and ARM64** architectures.

## Features

### Conversion Features
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple files in a single operation.
- **Supported Input Formats**: Handles GameCube and Wii disc images (`.iso`, `.gcm`, `.wbfs`, `.gcz`, `.wia`, `.ciso`, `.wbi`, `.tgc`, `.nfs`, `.nkit.iso`) and archives containing them (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`).
- **Archive Extraction**: Automatically extracts and processes game files from ZIP, 7Z, and RAR archives using SharpCompress.
- **Configurable Compression**: Customize compression method, level, and block size for optimal results.

- **Smart File Handling**: Skips files that already exist in the output directory.
- **Delete Original Option**: Optionally remove source files (including archives) after successful conversion.
- **Robust Parsing**: Advanced logic for handling compound extensions like `.nkit.iso` and localized number formats.

### Verification Features
- **RVZ Integrity Verification**: Verify the integrity of existing RVZ files natively with the RVZSharp volume verifier (partition headers, TMD/H3 tables and the h0/h1/h2/h3 hash trees), with DolphinTool as a fallback. CRC-32, MD5 and SHA-1 hashes of the decoded image are logged for every verified file.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live logging of verification progress and results (not just at the end).

### Explorer Features
- **Disc Explorer**: Browse the file system of any supported disc image (ISO, RVZ, WIA, GCZ, CISO, WBFS, TGC, NFS) in-process without extracting it.
- **Tree Navigation**: Expand folders and select entries to see their path, type, size and data offset.
- **Copy Out**: Extract the selected file or a whole folder from the image.
- **Per-File Hashing**: Compute the SHA-256 of any file inside the image.
- **Wii Partitions**: Discs with multiple partitions (game/update/channel) expose a partition selector.
- **Batch Verification**: Check multiple RVZ files in a single operation.

- **File Organization**: Automatically move verified files to `_Success` or `_Failed` subfolders.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Get comprehensive verification results for each file.

### User Experience
- **Smooth Progress Tracking**: A single, overall progress bar that smoothly tracks the entire batch operation, including real-time percentages from active tasks.
- **Intelligent Auto-Scroll**: The log viewer only snaps to the bottom if you are already looking at the latest logs, allowing you to read previous errors without interruption.
- **Immediate Cancellation**: Stop extractions and conversions instantly, even for massive 8GB+ files, thanks to asynchronous I/O and cancellation token support.
- **Optimized Logging**: Structured logging with Serilog, handling thousands of lines without UI stuttering or high memory usage.
- **Collapsible Settings Panels**: Settings sections use Expander controls (collapsed by default) to reduce visual clutter in all tabs.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Press F8 to capture the application window as a PNG screenshot.
- **Thread-Safe Dialogs**: Robust UI handling that prevents crashes when showing error messages or update prompts from background threads.
- **Auto-Update Checking**: Accurate version comparison between GitHub release tags and assembly versions with seamless GitHub integration.

### Technical Features
- **Native RVZ Engine**: Built-in `RVZSharp` library encodes, decodes and verifies disc images natively (100% managed codecs), with automatic fallback to `DolphinTool` whenever the library fails or DolphinTool is required.
- **Library Failure Reporting**: Unexpected `RVZSharp` failures are automatically reported to the Bug Report API so the library can be improved over time; expected user-file failures are logged without bug-report noise.
- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Fully async/await implementation to keep the UI responsive during intensive I/O and processing.
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Native support for both x64 and ARM64 Windows systems.
- **Structured Logging**: Serilog-based logging with rolling daily log files, on-screen log viewer, and automatic bug reporting via custom sinks.
- **Global Error Reporting**: Automatic bug reporting to developers with comprehensive error details.
- **Process Error Suppression**: Prevents Windows error dialogs from child processes (DolphinTool) from blocking batch operations.
- **Robust Child-Process Handling**: DolphinTool/7za startup failures (missing or blocked executables) are handled gracefully — the batch continues with the real error logged instead of crashing on process cleanup.
- **Cross-Platform UI**: The Avalonia-based interface runs natively on Windows, Linux and macOS, and automatically locates the platform-specific helper executables.
- **Robust Cleanup**: Asynchronous retry logic for deleting locked temporary files and directories.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient string handling and proper resource disposal to prevent leaks.

## Conversion Engine

RVZStudio uses **RVZSharp** — a pure managed C# library — as its primary engine for
converting disc images to RVZ (encode), decoding RVZ/WIA to any output format, and verifying
RVZ integrity:

- **Encode**: `RVZSharp` encodes ISO/GCM/WBFS/GCZ/WIA/CISO/TGC/NFS images natively with the
  selected compression method (zstd, bzip2, lzma, lzma2), level and block size. The `zlib` and
  `lz4` methods are DolphinTool-only and always use the external tool. A **Scrub** option zeroes
  non-game Wii partitions before encoding.
- **Decode**: `RVZSharp` writes ISO (parallel full-image decode), WIA, GCZ, WBFS, CISO and TGC
  natively. DolphinTool is only used as a fallback for the formats it supports (ISO/WIA/GCZ/WBFS).
- **Verify**: `RVZSharp` runs Dolphin's volume verification (Wii partition hash trees plus the
  TMD/H3 tables) and logs the decoded image's CRC-32, MD5 and SHA-1. DolphinTool `verify` is used
  as a fallback.
- **Automatic Fallback**: If the library fails on a file (corrupt input, unsupported feature,
  etc.), the application automatically falls back to `DolphinTool` for that file when DolphinTool
  supports the operation, and the batch continues normally.
- **Input Pre-validation**: Before encoding, the application verifies the input actually looks
  like a disc image — the GameCube/Wii disc header magic (Wii `5D 1C 9E A3` at offset 0x18,
  GameCube `C2 33 9F 3D` at offset 0x1C) on ISO/GCM files, and the real container magic
  (`WBFS`, GCZ `01 C0 0B B1`, `WIA\x01`/`RVZ\x01`, CISO `CISO`, TGC `AE 0F 38 A2`, NFS `EGGS`)
  on container files. Unrecognized data is sent to `DolphinTool` instead of being wrapped into a
  broken RVZ.
- **Failure Reporting**: Unexpected RVZSharp failures are logged at Error level and automatically
  sent to the Bug Report API with full error details; expected user-input failures (corrupt files,
  format mismatches, missing NFS keys) are logged at Information level.

## Supported File Formats

## About RVZ Format

RVZ is a compressed disk image format developed specifically for the Dolphin Emulator. It is designed to store GameCube and Wii game data efficiently while retaining all necessary information for emulation.

### Key Benefits
- **Efficient Compression**: Significantly reduces file sizes compared to raw ISO images using advanced compression algorithms like Zstandard.
- **Lossless**: Compression is completely lossless, meaning no game data is lost during conversion.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains all important disc metadata and structure.
- **Data Integrity**: Includes built-in verification to ensure image integrity.
- **Full Compatibility**: Directly supported by modern versions of Dolphin Emulator.
- **Faster Loading**: Often loads faster than uncompressed ISOs due to reduced I/O overhead.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: `DolphinTool` is optional — the built-in RVZSharp engine handles conversion, extraction and verification on its own. If the DolphinTool fallback is needed but missing, add `DolphinTool.exe` (or `DolphinTool_arm64.exe` for ARM64 systems) to the application directory.
- **Permission Issues**: Make sure you have read permissions for input directories and write permissions for output directories.
- **Archive Extraction Failures**: Verify that the archive files are not corrupted. The app now supports instant cancellation if extraction hangs.
- **Conversion Errors**: Check the detailed real-time log output for specific error messages. Log files are also saved to `%LocalAppData%\RVZStudio\logs\`.
- **Font-Related Rendering Issues**: If UI text fails to render on systems with missing or broken system fonts, the application stays running and logs the font error — consider restoring your system fonts.
- **Performance Issues**: Try reducing the number of concurrent files if you experience system instability.
- **Auto-Reporting**: The application automatically reports unexpected errors to developers for continuous improvement.

### Building from Source
1. Install [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `dotnet build` or open in Visual Studio / JetBrains Rider / Visual Studio Code

See the [Building guide](doc/building.md) for full instructions.

### Publishing
The `publish.ps1` script produces self-contained, single-file builds for every supported platform
(`win-x64`, `win-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64`) into the `publish/`
folder. The DolphinTool/7za helper executables are placed next to the application binary so they
can be launched as child processes.

```powershell
./publish.ps1
```

A single target can also be published manually:
```bash
dotnet publish RVZStudio/RVZStudio.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 \
    --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

### Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions pipelines live in `.github/workflows/`:

- **CI** (`ci.yml`) builds and tests on Windows, Linux and macOS for every push and pull request,
  and smoke-tests Linux publishing.
- **Release** (`release.yml`) publishes all six runtime identifiers and attaches the ZIP archives
  to a GitHub Release when a `v*` tag is pushed.

See the [Building guide](doc/building.md#continuous-integration) for details.

### Running Tests
The project includes unit tests covering models and services using xUnit:
```bash
dotnet test
```
